1.)Polymorphism is the the condition of ocurring in several different forms.
2.) In coding it is the ability for different objects to respond in unique ways to the same instruction.  An example is the getTransactionFee methosd in our payment card lab
3.)We can use interfaces to implement polymorphisma and also abstract classes
4.) There are many discussions around this.  But I am led to believe 2?
5.)You could use polymorphism to to model different kinds of Car using the abstract class of Vehicle to make use of common properties.

6.)We speak of composition as a way to describe the components of an object ie, what an object is made of.
7.)You'd use composition to build an object using other objects with their own properties that, on their own bear no relation to each other but when used as part of another object, have useful relationships.
8.)Composition allows an object to have multiple components whereas inhertance allows for only one.
9.)It's all gone!  Everything is destroye, scorched earth, javageddon, end of days.
